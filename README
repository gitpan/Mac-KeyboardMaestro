NAME
    Mac::KeyboardMaestro - Run Keyboard Maestro macros

SYNOPSIS
       use Mac::KeyboardMaestro qw(km_macro km_set km_get);

       # set a Keybaord Maestro variable
       km_set "VarName", $value;

       # run a Keyboard Maestro macro
       km_macro "Reticulate Splines";

       # get a Keboard Maestro variable
       my $result = km_get "OtherVar";

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple interface to the OS X keyboard macro program
    Keyboard Maestro.

    The standard way recommended by the Keyboard Maestro application to talk
    to it via Perl is to shell out to "osascript" and pass that an
    AppleScript program that calls Keyboard Maestro. This module avoids this
    and talks the same AppleScript directly in process (which is quicker)
    and handles all the character escaping necessary to avoid executing
    parts of your macro/varible names and values as AppleScript by mistake.

  Functions
    These functions can be imported, or you can use them fully qualified.
    All functions throw exceptions if the AppleScript interface to Keyboard
    Maestro returns an error.

    km_macro $macro_name
    km_macro $macro_uuid
        Execute the named macro / macro with the passed uuid. Returns an
        empty list.

    km_set $varname, $value
        Sets the value of the corrisponding Keyboard Maestro variable.
        $value will be automatically stringified. Returns an empty list.

    km_get $varname
        Gets the current value of the corrisponding Keyboard Maestro
        variable. Returns an empty string if the variable does not exist.

    km_delete $varname
        Deletes the corrisponding Keyboard Maestro variable. Returns an
        empty list.
